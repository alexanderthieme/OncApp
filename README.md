# OncApp

> üò∑ Solution for assessing electronic patient reported outcomes (ePROs) for cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.

OncApp can help users to assess their medical condition better or provide recommendations regarding doctor‚Äôs visits.

Additionally, every filled out questionnaire summarizes relevant medical information for future doctor‚Äôs consultation in the form of a summary page, printout or a QR code. Institutions with the technical setup can scan the provided QR code and retrieve the patient information quickly and without any physical contact.

By implementing the OncApp, any medical institution can reduce the number of new incoming patients, avoid physical contact and speed up the patient registration process.

The application and underlying questionnaire logic [are versioned and future updates will be provided](#application-updates).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Any institution/doctor‚Äôs office is free to implement OncApp on their domains ‚Äì the medical responsibility and legal liability lie with the implementing institution.**

It is based on a JavaScript software stack and uses the following technologies:

- [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [WebComponents](https://www.webcomponents.org/)
