# OncApp

> :stethoscope: :iphone: A web app for cancer patients to detect relaps and treatment complications.

OncApp fills the gap in information between doctor’s visits for cancer patients. OncApp analyzes symptoms and immediately generates recommendations which are based on expert knowledge and machine learning models.

Patient responses are evaluated in regards to risk of relapse, pain, nutrition and infection. If an unfavorable medical condition is detected, a further course of action is immediately suggested to the patient. Simultaneously, OncApp sends these results to their doctors for assessment and further investigation.


Additionally, every filled out questionnaire summarizes relevant medical information for future doctor’s consultation in the form of a summary page, printout or a QR code. Institutions with the technical setup can scan the provided QR code and retrieve the patient information quickly and without any physical contact.

By implementing the OncApp, any medical institution can improve cancer care, counteract treatment complications and reduce number of emergency admissions and treatment costs.
