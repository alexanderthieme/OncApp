# OncApp

> ðŸ˜· Solution for assessing electronic patient reported outcomes (ePROs) for cancer patients receiving cancer treatment.

OncApp can help users to assess their medical condition better or provide recommendations regarding doctorâ€™s visits.

Additionally, every filled out questionnaire summarizes relevant medical information for future doctorâ€™s consultation in the form of a summary page, printout or a QR code. Institutions with the technical setup can scan the provided QR code and retrieve the patient information quickly and without any physical contact.

By implementing the OncApp, any medical institution can improve cancer care, counteract treatment complications and reduce number of emergency admissions and costs.
