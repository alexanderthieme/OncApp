# PoxApp

> :stethoscope: :iphone: A web app to assess the risk for infection with the monkey pox virus.

Solution for assessing the risk of contagious viral infections (COVID-19)

PoxApp can help users to assess their medical condition better, provide recommendations regarding doctor’s visits or coronavirus testing by answering a few questions. 

Additionally, every filled out questionnaire summarizes relevant medical information for future doctor’s consultation in the form of a summary page, printout or a QR code. Institutions with the technical setup can scan the provided QR code and retrieve the patient information quickly and without any physical contact.

By implementing the PoxApp, any medical institution can reduce the number of new incoming patients, avoid physical contact and speed up the patient registration process.
